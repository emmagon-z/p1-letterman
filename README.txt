The file Error_messages.txt contains standardized error messages, to help
the autograder help you.  Please read it and use those error messages,
and never ever exit(1) without an explanation as to why the program is
exiting.


This set of sample files includes the following:

spec-simple.txt                - From the project specification
spec-complex.txt               - From the project specification
second-example-simple.txt      - From the Project specification, "Second Example"

There are also some output files, for various command line options.

There's also dictionary-medium.txt.  This file is intended to be used
for speed testing, such as using perf.  You'll have to come up with your
own begin and end words, options, etc., but it's hard to test speed with
only 20 words in the dictionary.  No output files are provided with this;
it's only intended for speed testing, not correctness.
